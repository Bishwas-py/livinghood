# Equality

Equality, is something that every society seeks, specially the minorities. But are minorities only on a human
society? Are cows, dogs, babies, cars and calculators minorities, who is going to speak for them? Equality is
something that allows every member of a working organized system to feel similar to each other, each cogs has
an sense of ownership, individual existence and common interest.

## Essence

Equality according to Livinghood, is based on essence. Essence is the core of every living being,
it is the thing that makes a living being alive. The essence of a human is the same as the essence of a
dog, a cow, a baby and a tree.

The essence of a criminal is the same as the essence of a judge, a police officer and a lawyer. So, essentially,
everyone is equal in the sense of existence. You can't say that a criminal is less human than a judge, because
both of them are humans and they have the same essence.
