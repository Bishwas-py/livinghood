# Livinghood - The political ideology of the 21st century

We as human have been through a lot of wars, natural events and ruling systems. Ruling systems
are being continuosly changed and we are still not satisfied with the current one.

From the beginning of the human history, we have been ruled by kings, queens, emperors and dictators. Monarchy to capitalism to communism to socialism to democracy.
